Simplify essentials setup with time-based input,Design,Calendar & Scheduling,"Replace the drag-and-drop sleep block experience with a simpler input flow where users specify sleep and wake times, and the system auto-populates the calendar. The current approach feels like administrative paperwork and is particularly cumbersome without keyboard shortcuts. Consider treating essentials as a one-time configuration rather than a weekly planning activity, allowing users to set their typical schedule once and carry it forward automatically.",Turn ambitions into scheduled work,Feature,"Sleep block drag-and-drop feels overly cumbersome, Consider removing entire Essentials feature for simplicity, Make all essentials optional and editable",,Backlog
Replace solid time blocks with subtle visual boundaries,Design,UX & Interface,"Transform sleep and work hour blocks from solid colored rectangles into subtle visual indicators such as background shading, subtle lines with icons, or creative hour mark treatments on the calendar edge. Large solid blocks create psychological overwhelm and visual clutter even when representing passive time like sleep. Drawing from Sunsama and Apple Calendar approaches, use unobtrusive visual boundaries that preserve intentionality while reducing the oppressive feeling of a filled calendar.",See all commitments in one place,Improvement,"Sleep blocks create visual overwhelm on calendar, Consider work hours as subtle line not solid blocks",,Backlog
Rename Hygiene to Morning Routine in essentials,Design,UX & Interface,"Replace the term 'Hygiene' with 'Morning routine' or 'Evening routine' in the essentials section. The current label triggered immediate confusion and visceral negative reactions during user testing, with literal interpretations suggesting the app is asking users to schedule bathroom time. Productivity culture terminology like 'morning routine' is more intuitive and eliminates an unnecessary friction point during onboarding.",Turn ambitions into scheduled work,Bug,"Hygiene label causes confusion and negative reaction, Commitments vs Goals naming creates confusion",,Backlog
Make milestones optional and visually distinct from tasks,Design,Goals & Planning,"Redesign the milestones feature to be clearly optional and visually differentiated from tasks. Currently both use identical checkboxes, creating cognitive overhead about what distinguishes them. If kept, milestones should function as collapsible section headers with tasks nested underneath, focusing attention on the current milestone while de-emphasizing future ones. Consider hiding milestones in advanced settings rather than displaying them prominently between goal and tasks.",Balance attention across priorities,Improvement,"Milestones feature is confusing and may not be needed, Consider linking tasks to milestones if keeping feature",,Backlog
Enable user customization of life areas,Design,Goals & Planning,"Allow users to add custom life areas to the existing defaults while preserving the core set. Career doesn't fit everyone—content creators might need Content and Software as separate areas, while professionals with side projects would benefit from Day Job and Side Hustle distinctions. The dropdown interaction and inspiration feature are praised, but personalization is essential for the feature to resonate across diverse user contexts and build genuine connection with the system.",Balance attention across priorities,Feature,Users need ability to customize life areas,,Backlog
Simplify progress tracking to scheduled calendar time,Design,Goals & Planning,"Replace the unit of progress selection (focus time, completed time, tasks) with a simpler model: plan your week by setting intended time allocation per goal, then compare scheduled vs actual time at week's end. Users should choose a single preference for how completion is inferred—either past calendar blocks are assumed done, or only manually tracked time counts. Show secondary metrics like days practiced and completion counts without requiring user configuration.",Understand where time actually goes,Improvement,"Unit of progress selection adds unnecessary complexity, Progress metrics should be deferred to reduce complexity",,Backlog
Highlight priority tasks selected during weekly planning,Design,Goals & Planning,"When users select specific tasks as their weekly priorities during the intention-setting flow, visually highlight those tasks throughout the week. This implements the high-priority task concept organically—users can mark the most important task for each goal and see it emphasized in task lists and on the calendar. This preserves valuable specificity while simplifying the broader intention-setting experience.",Turn ambitions into scheduled work,Feature,Specific task selection for weekly intention is valuable,,Backlog
Merge time intention and calendar planning into single step,Design,Calendar & Scheduling,"Combine the 'set hours intention' and 'drag blocks to calendar' steps into a unified experience where dragging blocks onto the calendar reveals emergent time allocation rather than working toward a pre-set target. Users should drag, then see 'you've scheduled 8 hours for YouTube' as discovered information. The current flow of committing to hours before scheduling feels backwards and creates ambiguity about the intended workflow.",Turn ambitions into scheduled work,Improvement,Time intention vs calendar drag order is confusing,,Backlog
Ensure core interactions work without keyboard shortcuts,Design,UX & Interface,"Audit and redesign all core interactions to be pleasant and efficient using only mouse and touch input. While power users can discover shortcuts for speed, 90% of normal users never adopt them even in apps where they're prominent. The essentials experience becomes cumbersome without shortcuts, violating a foundational UX principle. Invest in discoverable right-click context menus and on-screen controls for all primary actions.",Turn ambitions into scheduled work,Improvement,Design must assume users won't use keyboard shortcuts,,Backlog
Make gap-filling default behavior when dragging blocks,Design,Calendar & Scheduling,"Invert the current gap-filling behavior so that blocks snap to fill gaps by default, with Shift key enabling overlap placement. Most users want clean non-overlapping calendars, and most won't discover the Shift shortcut. Since satisfying calendars have neat adjacent blocks and overlaps create visual clutter, the default should reflect the common case without requiring keyboard modifier knowledge.",Turn ambitions into scheduled work,Improvement,Gap-filling should be default behavior when dragging,,Backlog
Add checkbox indicator to calendar task blocks,Design,UX & Interface,"Display a small checkbox icon on calendar blocks that represent completable tasks to distinguish them from regular calendar events. Without this visual affordance, it's not immediately obvious that a block is a task versus a fixed appointment. This improves scannability and helps users understand the different item types on their calendar at a glance, particularly for single-task blocks.",See all commitments in one place,Improvement,Tasks in calendar need visible checkbox indicator,,Backlog
Remove essential stats from weekly analytics,Design,Focus & Time Management,"Exclude essentials (sleep, eat, routines) from the weekly analytics percentage calculations. Showing '29% of sleep commitment completed' on Tuesday provides no actionable insight and prevents users from ever reaching 100% satisfaction until the week literally ends. Goal progress stats inform prioritization decisions, but essential stats are noise that clutter the view and undermine the motivational dopamine hit of completion.",Understand where time actually goes,Improvement,"Essential stats like sleep percentage are meaningless, Essentials prevent achieving 100% satisfaction until week end",,Backlog
Prioritize goal creation over essentials in onboarding,Design,Onboarding & Growth,"Resequence the first-time user experience to lead with goal creation before introducing essentials. Setting goals is exciting and motivating—it's the 'aha moment' of seeing ambitions on a planning canvas. Dragging sleep blocks is cumbersome and unusual. Users should experience the core value proposition quickly, with essentials introduced later as optional time-awareness features for those who want that level of structure.",Turn ambitions into scheduled work,Improvement,First-time experience should prioritize goals over essentials,,Backlog
Add unplanned time visibility to weekly analytics,Design,Focus & Time Management,"Surface unplanned time as a visible metric alongside goals in weekly analytics, showing hours and percentage. This isn't about enforcing 100% planning, but providing a sanity check when more than 15-20% of the week is unaccounted for. Users benefit from understanding the gap between planned intentions and actual time allocation, helping identify where unstructured time might be leaking.",Understand where time actually goes,Feature,Show unplanned time percentage in weekly analytics,,Backlog
Include deadlines when marking day as complete,Design,Calendar & Scheduling,"Fix the keyboard shortcut for marking a day as complete to also consider and mark deadline-based tasks as complete. Currently the shortcut only handles time-blocked items, leaving deadline tasks in an inconsistent state. This creates confusion about what 'completing the day' actually accomplishes and reduces trust in the completion workflow.",Understand where time actually goes,Bug,Marking a day as complete does not mark deadlines as complete,,Backlog
Enable focus mode on goals without scheduled blocks,Design,Focus & Time Management,"Allow users to start a focus timer directly on a goal without requiring a pre-scheduled calendar block. When the timer ends, prompt the user about adding the session as a block to the calendar. Regardless of their choice, save the focus session to analytics. This supports spontaneous deep work while maintaining accurate time tracking for goals.",Turn ambitions into scheduled work,Feature,Get into focus on a goal regardless of block,,Backlog
Expand deadline feature with enhanced visibility,Design,Tasks & Productivity,"Build on the strongly validated deadline feature by exploring ways to enhance its visibility and usefulness. Both reviewers expressed enthusiasm ('LOVE THE DEADLINE THING'), indicating deadlines address a real user need around time-bound task management. Consider opportunities to double down on this capability—perhaps deadline warnings, calendar integration, or priority surfacing based on approaching due dates.",Turn ambitions into scheduled work,Feature,"Deadline feature is loved by reviewers, Days practised metric enables momentum integration",,Backlog
