# Goals Domain Types (Relocated)

**Status:** Code files have been merged into `lib/unified-schedule/types.ts` to reduce indirection.

The types previously defined here (`NewGoalData`, `InspirationGoal`, `InspirationCategory`) now live in `lib/unified-schedule/types.ts` and are exported from `lib/unified-schedule/index.ts`.

## Where to find things

- **NewGoalData** — `import type { NewGoalData } from "@/lib/unified-schedule"`
- **InspirationGoal** — `import type { InspirationGoal } from "@/lib/unified-schedule"`
- **InspirationCategory** — `import type { InspirationCategory } from "@/lib/unified-schedule"`
- **LifeArea** — `import type { LifeArea } from "@/lib/types"`
- **GoalIconOption** — `import type { GoalIconOption } from "@/lib/types"`

**Total Files:** 0 (documentation only)
