SuperOS is built for people with more ambition than time. The more competing goals you have, and/or the more time pressures there are on your goals, the more helpful SuperOS becomes.

Our overarching value proposition to users is that SuperOS will significantly increase their odds of achieving their goals within the available time they have. SuperOS is designed for:

Time awareness: a core belief underpinning SuperOS is that calendars are a much better canvas for planning than to-do lists, because calendars force you to come to terms with the reality of limited time. As opposed to to-do lists that have unlimited rows, you only have 168h blocks per week in a calendar. An additional benefit of this time-based canvas (= the calendar): by being more aware of limited time, you’re less likely to procrastinate.

10x more effective planning, through:

Keeping your goals and constraints more top-of-mind: research shows that by writing down your goal, why they matter and any relevant constraints (e.g. deadlines, available time) and re-reading this every day, you’re more likely to make progress on your goals. At SuperOS, we make sure you backward engineer from your goals and constraints to keep both the immediate next step and your longer-term vision/why top of mind at all times.

A single, visual canvas: most productivity tools silo off different projects (e.g. “work” and “life” will tend to sit in different spaces in your to-do list). At SuperOS, we help you plan that holistically. Every project’s time allocation is listed on the same canvas (the SuperOS calendar).

80/20 planning: most productivity tools help you do more (movement). SuperOS helps you focus on the essential (the 80/20), so you can go further on what actually matters (progress). We help you (a) understand the tradeoffs and implications of your current time spend (b) notice and eliminate the non-essential and (c) and go deeper on the initiatives that are most likely to move the needle.

Time protection: we make your colleagues, family and friends aware of which blocks you’ll be unavailable, and share just the right information with them

Frictionless dumping of all your tasks and intentions: so nothing slips through. This is considered a tablestakes feature (not an innovation per se).

Our planning support features are anchored in Ali Abdaal’s productivity philosophy.

Effortless flow: we help you get into full focus (and ultimately, flow) more easily, by simultaneously (i) eliminating distractions (ii) reminding me of my intentions and (iii) making the hardest cognitive challenges feel like a game. To quote Ali’s FGP book: “If you want to achieve more without ruining your life, the first step is to approach your work with a sense of play”.

Our current goal is to hit 40% DAU (DAU = 10 days over the last 14 days, to account for weekends) and 0.3x referrals on 2 or more successive Founding Member cohorts as soon as possible. Every sprint should optimise for:

Delivering the most incremental value possible on the aforementioned value proposition (+ items 1-3 above)- with the least amount of time. The DAU and referral metrics can be considered proxy improvement trackers of that goal.

Building for flexibility: as users get onboarded, we’ll get more and better signals about what is most likely to deliver incremental product value. To build a world-class product, we’ll likely have to continuously iterate the product. With that in mind, we should aim to (a) build the codebase in a way that doesn’t make it overly hard to iterate on it and (b) try to capture as much context as possible on users’ goals, tasks, time intention, time intention and reflections as possible, so that we can provide better tools and recommendations (= tools and recommendations they can’t get anywhere else) over time. In the age of AI, “context is king” so it’s likely that the more context we have about users = the more opportunities we’ll have to deliver value as a product.
