# Text extension

The `Text` extension is required, at least if you want to work with text of any kind and that’s very likely. This extension is a little bit different, it doesn’t even render HTML. It’s plain text, that’s all.

### Breaking Change

Tiptap v1 tried to hide that node from you, but it has always been there. You have to explicitly import it from now on (or use [StarterKit](/docs/editor/extensions/functionality/starterkit)).

## [](#install)Install

```
npm install @tiptap/extension-text
```
